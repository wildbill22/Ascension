This adds in a camp structure that spawns throughout your world. The structure includes tents, a campfire, loot chests, crafting table and
furnace, and some decor to tweak it off. 

The chests include armor, weapons, tools, resources, and food supply. All tools and armor will be
either iron, diamond, or a special sword from the mod. resources will be iron, leather, obsidian (rare), diamond (rare), and saplings. Foods
will be apples, bread, or other special foods from the mod. The chests will sometimes add potions.

The schematic includes 2 chest, create them both.

Sometime, we should have mobs like thieves to invade the camps, but that's a future plan. Remember that not many things have been added quite yet
